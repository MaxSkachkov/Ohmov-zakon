# Ohm's Law Graph
⚡ Interactive Ohm's Law Graph – Pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript
This standalone HTML file (no external libraries) allows you to:

Input voltage (U) and resistance (R),

Automatically calculate the current (I) using the formula I = U / R,

Dynamically draw the I(U) graph (current as a function of voltage),

All done using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – no dependencies or internet required.

Perfect for educational use or quick interactive demos of Ohm’s Law. Just open the file in any browser and explore the relationship between voltage, resistance, and current in real time.
